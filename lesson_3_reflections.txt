Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A: 1) When you want to be able to access your reflections from anywhere with an Internet connection.
2) When you don't want to lose it all if your hard drive crashes.
3) When you want to show your repository to others.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: So you can make sure you won't lose any changes you made locally by controlling when you want to sync and checking if it's safe to do so first.
