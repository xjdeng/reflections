Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A: 1) When you want to be able to access your reflections from anywhere with an Internet connection.
2) When you don't want to lose it all if your hard drive crashes.
3) When you want to show your repository to others.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A: So you can make sure you won't lose any changes you made locally by controlling when you want to sync and checking if it's safe to do so first.


Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A: Forks allow you to take someone else's project, copy it to your Github, and continue development of it as your own while giving the original author credit.
Clones are just copies of another's Github repository on your Github (while giving the original credit.)
Branches are just a different development path that your own project might take.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

A: That way, you can work on the project locally without having to access the Internet and it also makes it less prone to conflicts in the future.
