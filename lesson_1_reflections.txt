Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

A: It helped me focus on discrepancies between the files rather than search through them endlessly one by one.

Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

A: You can revisit old code you've written in the past and perhaps revert back to older code when you've inadvertedly introduced bugs in newer code.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

A: Most programming projects are structured so that the final product is dependent on multiple files functioning together while documents stored in Google Docs are assumed to be separate entities unrelated to each other.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

A: Using git long will give you a list of IDs for the changes made.  Using git diff lets you compare the differences between 2 or more different changes based on their ID.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

A: Much more confident now because I have a way to revert back in case I do break something!

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

A: I'd like using it for my 2nd Machine Learning project
