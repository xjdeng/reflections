Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git now knows there's a new repository created so you can create commits to it in the future.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is like a set of instructions being drafted of the next change that'll be made to the repository.  It involves some or all of the files in the working directory.
