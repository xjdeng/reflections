Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A: Git now knows there's a new repository created so you can create commits to it in the future.

Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A: The staging area is like a set of instructions being drafted of the next change that'll be made to the repository.  It involves some or all of the files in the working directory.

Q: How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

A: Use the git status command to preview the changes that will be made.

Q: What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

A: It would help when you want to test out new features in your program. Branches help organize your program when one version is going off in a different direction than another.
